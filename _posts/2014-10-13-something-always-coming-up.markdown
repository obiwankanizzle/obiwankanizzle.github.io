There always something coming up that prevents you from doing what you need to do or want to do. I should have been working on this blog for a while but I have only worked on this thing for a couple of hours and I feel frustrated and annoyed. So we had our trip out Atlanta this weekend and it was fun, but I wish I was working on the blog. Hopefully as everything continues I will continue to work on it and hopefully this will get better.
